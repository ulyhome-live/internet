> ## **To be absolutely sure your ports are open and accessible from the public internet,** you’ll need to check from **both inside and outside** your network.

Here’s a step-by-step guide for **testing your port forwarding/NAT rules**:

---

## **1. Understanding the Basics**

* **ss/nc/curl** test *inside* your LAN, but they **don’t guarantee** that traffic from the internet is reaching you (because your router/firewall might still block it).
* **To verify from the outside**, you need to test from a device not on your home network, or use online port-checking tools.

---

## **2. Check Your Current Public IP**

First, make sure your DuckDNS domain is pointing to your current public IP.

* **Check your public IP**:

  ```
  curl ifconfig.me
  ```

  or go to [https://ifconfig.me](https://ifconfig.me) in your browser.
* **Ping your DuckDNS domain**:

  ```
  ping nasmj.duckdns.org
  ```

  Ensure it matches your ATT public IP.

## **3. Test Ports from Outside Your Network**

### **A. Use Online Port Checking Tools**

Use [https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/)

* Enter your DuckDNS domain or public IP.
* Test these ports (one at a time):

  * 80 (HTTP)
  * 443 (HTTPS)
  * 3478 (Talk STUN/TURN)

**You should see “Port is open” if the forward is working.**

### **B. Test with a Mobile Device (not on WiFi)**

* **Turn off WiFi** and use mobile data.
* In your browser, open:

  * `http://nasmj.duckdns.org` (should redirect to HTTPS and load Nextcloud)
  * `https://nasmj.duckdns.org`
* You can also use an SSH app to test port 3478 (for advanced users).

---

## **4. Advanced: Command-Line Test from External Server**

If you have access to a VPS or cloud server (like DigitalOcean, AWS, etc), SSH in and run:

```bash
curl -I http://nasmj.duckdns.org
curl -I https://nasmj.duckdns.org
nc -vz nasmj.duckdns.org 3478
nc -vzu nasmj.duckdns.org 3478
```

This will show if your public ports are reachable from **anywhere on the internet**.

---

## **5. Troubleshooting If Ports Are Not Open**

* **Double check your ATT NAT/Gaming rules:**
  Make sure the correct external ports are forwarded to the correct local IPs.
* **Restart your modem/router** after changes.
* **DuckDNS is updating to your correct IP.**
* **No double NAT:** If you have another router behind the ATT gateway, either put it in bridge/passthrough mode, or forward from BOTH routers.
* **Firewall on your LXC/container host**: Make sure UFW/iptables is not blocking the port.

## **Summary Table**

| **Port** | **What to Test**    | **Where to Test**       | **Expected Result**   |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 80       | Nextcloud/NPM HTTP  | Online checker, browser | Port open, site loads |
| 443      | Nextcloud/NPM HTTPS | Online checker, browser | Port open, site loads |
| 3478     | Talk STUN/TURN      | Online checker, netcat  | Port open             |

---

* If a port shows **closed**, tell me which port and I’ll walk you through the exact fix for ATT NAT/Gaming or firewall.
* If you want a script or screenshots, let me know your preference!

**You’re almost done! Checking from the outside is the real test for remote access and Nextcloud Talk reliability.**
